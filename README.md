## Usage
Run `npm install` then `npm start` to develop locally.

Based on `.env.template`, create an `.env` file in the root of this repository with your own Mapbox token and style.
I've included my customised Mapbox style. Please attribute me if you do use this style (:

`npm run build` builds the files to be served on any web server.
